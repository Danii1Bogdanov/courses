Given the integer `N` (`1 ≤ N≤ 40`). List all the decompositions of `N` into the 
whole positive addends.

The addends should go in non-ascending order within each decomposition.

Output all decompositions in the lexicographical order.

### Sample Input:

```
5
```

### Sample Output:

```
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 1 1
2 2 1
3 1 1
