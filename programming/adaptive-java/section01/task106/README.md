You need to sort the time moments, specified in hours, minutes and seconds.

Input data

The first line contains number `N` (`1 <= N <= 100`), and the next `N` lines â€“
`N` time intervals. Each time interval is set by three integers - hours (from
0 to 23), minutes (from 0 to 59) and seconds (from 0 to 59).

### Output data

Output the time intervals, sorted in nondecreasing order without leading zeroes.

### Sample Input:

```
3
13 15 0
9 45 0
23 59 59
```

### Sample Output:

```
9 45 0
13 15 0
23 59 59
```
