Given a sequence of natural numbers, not exceeding `30000`. Find the its maximum element
divisible by 4. As input, the program gets the number of elements in
the sequence, and then the elements themselves. In the sequence, there is always
an element divisible by `4`. The number of elements does not exceed `1000`. The program should
print the single number â€“ the maximum element of the sequence divisible by `4`.

### Sample Input:

```

68
58
44
47
59
36
13
12
