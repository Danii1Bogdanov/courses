[GC-content][1] is an important feature of the genome sequences and
is defined as the percentage ratio of the sum of all guanines and
cytosines to the overall number of nucleic bases in the genome sequence.
Write a program, which calculates the percentage of G characters (guanine)
and C characters (cytosine) in the entered string. Your program should be
case independent.

For example, in the string "acggtgttat" the percentage of characters
G and C equals to `(4/10)â‹…100 = 40.0`, where `4` is the number of symbols
G and C, and `10` is the length of the string.

Output your result as a double value.

### Sample Input:

```
acggtgttat
```

### Sample Output:

```
40.0
```
