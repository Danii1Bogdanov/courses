## Generic functions

Make the following code compile by implementing a
`partitionTo` function that splits a collection into
two collections according to the predicate.

There is a [`partition()`][1] function in the standard
library that always returns two newly created lists. You
should write a function that splits the collection into
two collections given as arguments. The signature of the
[`toCollection()`][2] function from the standard library
may help you.
